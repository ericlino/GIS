# GIS
Beginner GIS commands on gdal, Rstudio or whatever pops up.
This repository is made for users that are beginners on programming and want to start using commands and scripts instead of interfaces. Any contribution is welcome.

######################################### BASIC CMD NAVIGATION ###################################################
First of all, since our commands will be used directly on cmd (prompt), let's clear some basic stuff:

After opening the cmd, you can navigate through your folders using the "cd" (Change Directory) command. eg: "cd C:\User\Documents" will take you to your Documents folder. 

- "cd\" will take you to the top of the tree (on our example, C:\)
- "cd.." will take you one folder above (on our example, C:\User\)
- "cd /d (path here)" takes you to a folder on a different drive 
- "dir" lets you see the data information on a certain folder; files and sizes
- "MKDIR" or "MD" creates folders on a given folder. eg: "md new_folder" would create a folder called "new_folder" under C:\User\ (remember our last example?)
- "REN" renames a already existing folder. eg: "ren new_folder useful_folder" would rename it to "useful_folder"
