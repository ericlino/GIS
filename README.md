# Introduction to Coding for GIS

## Repository Description:

If you fooled with GIS applications such as QGIS or ArcGIS long enough, you have probably faced problems that either took long enough to solve or resulted in a crash. This repository is made for users that are looking for alternative ways to analyze spatial data and therefore are giving their first steps on programming to start using commands and scripts instead of interfaces. 

## Why this project ~~is~~ could be useful:

Having no formal education on programming, I found it somewhat hard to leave the safety and cozyness of GIS softwares to start using commands on the terminal and python scripts mostly because not only learning to code is already a challenge on itself, but also because programmers (and programmer-oriented software and websites) have a very specific form of organizing their data which might seem extremely omplicated for someone that has never dealt with it before. APIs and gigantic documentations easily scare biologists, geographers and many other people that are curious and don't want to be left behind as informatics become more and more important.

Having that said, the objective of this manuscript can be divided in two: **First**, to provide a detailed explaination of the basic knowledge required to learn programming, focusing on showing patterns and how should you think when writing code and **second**, to reunite many basic functions and commands commonly used to operate spatial data.

## Where can you contribute:

By no means I'm an expert at coding nor Github. I still have a very long way to go, so any help (from code lines to repository formatting) is appreciated. But if you **really** want to help, you can help achieve the secret third objective intended with this guide, which is to compare different tools with a common goal. Ex: Let's say I have on the guide one way to rasterize using R and another using Python. Which function is preferred? When to use one and one to use another, what are the limitations?
